## Setup

Clone this repository in your local system and run 'setup.py':

```
    python3 setup.py install
```



The folder üìÅ **bts_gelsight-main** contains python codes used for controlling the UR5e arm, the compliant gripper, and to record the data from Gelsight and BTS sensor.
The folder also contains python script to control the compliant gripper.


The folder üìÅ **Linear_angular_fig3and4** contains MATLAB codes used to control the servo and record the data for the Linear slip experiments and characterization experiemnts in Fig.3 and Fig 4a-4d.
